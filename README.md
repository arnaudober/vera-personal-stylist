## Roadmap
- [x] Make available the MVP for private testing
- [x] Outfit history — track what was worn recently to avoid repetition
- [x] Favorite outfits — save and revisit liked combinations
- [x] Improve today page design — better layout, visual consistency with other pages, unified outfit card, FAB regenerate
- [x] Improve favourites page — add "ready to wear" filter, "wear it" quick action, unified card design
- [x] Outfit drag-and-drop — drag the whole outfit to the basket instead of individual items
- [x] Strikethrough dirty items — replace clean/dirty badges with a visual strikethrough on items in the laundry, also on the favourites page
- [x] Replace drag-and-drop on today page — replace with a simpler interaction (e.g. a confirm button) to improve discoverability
- [x] Move basket to closet page — the laundry basket fits better on the closet page; rethink the today page layout so it doesn't feel empty without it
- [x] More categories — shoes, accessories, jackets/coats
- [x] Add more accessory categories — watches, earrings, etc.
- [ ] Improve category cleanliness rules — let some categories be excluded from clean/dirty tracking
- [ ] Improve closet filter-bar — make horizontal scrolling more obvious so users understand they can browse categories sideways, or maybe use a dropdown instead of a bar
- [ ] Improved onboarding — guided tour for new users
- [ ] Horizontal scroll views — closet page with one row per category (tops, bottoms) scrolling horizontally; favourites page with a single horizontal row of outfits
- [ ] Pin item to outfit — select an item from the closet to lock it into today's outfit, then regenerate the rest around it; also remove the "clean" badge since this action replaces it as the primary CTA for clean items
- [ ] Multi-season — adapt suggestions to the current season
- [ ] Add notification for suggestion once a day, reminders for laundry to be done after a few days
- [ ] Improve suggestion algorithm with weather, occasions, etc.
- [ ] Social sharing — get friends' opinions on an outfit
- [ ] Release a first version to the public
